# Why Next.JS???

NextJS is a React Framework that allows you to handle all your application needs through a single library. Application needs like state management, routing, and more can be handled through NextJS and adhere to standards set forth by NextJS creators; a company called Vercel.

# Next.JS Dependencies

NextJS requires the following in order to run

* ReactJS - For components
* NodeJS - For API
* SWC or Babel - For Compiling (perfereably SWC)
* Webpack - For bundling

# Appendix

#### What is SWC?

"SPEEDY WEB COMPILER" (SWC)

SWC is an alternative transpiler written in Rust and significantly faster than Babel. 

Babel is a tool used to "transpile" newer versions of JavaScript into older versions.

Babel is written in JavaScript and is therefore really, really slow.

Rust is a compiled, type-based language that can SMOKE javascript in performance because Rust's compiler does not have to evaluate as much as javascript (thanks to types!).
